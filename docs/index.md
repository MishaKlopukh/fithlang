# The Fith Programming Language

Welcome to the documentation for the Fith programming language!

Run `pip install fithlang` to get started, or go through the basic tutorial
found [here](getting_started).

## About Fith

Fith is a stack based language inspired by forth. It was written in 2021 at the 
[MPCR Lab](https://mpcrlab.com/) to target the 5vm. It aims to have a very simple
syntax, be highly extensible, and be easy to implement. The compiler, vm, and suite
are written in Python 3, with sources available on [Github](https://github.com/MishaKlopukh/fithlang), 
although efforts are underway to write the fith compiler in fith itself.

## About 5vm

The 5vm is a one-instruction-set-computer with memory-mapped operations on which
fith code is run. For a more detailed description, click [here](5vm).
